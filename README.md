#TURBULENCE

> To make honey, young bee need young flower, not old prune

## Quick start

1. Run `$ yarn` to install dependencies.

1. Start Mongodb `$ mongod` *(see prerequisites)*

1. At this point you can run `$ yarn start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

Application has two separate directory `app` and `server`. The entry point for frontend is `src/app/app.js` file and for backend it is `src/server/index.js`.

## Development

### Scripts

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `$ yarn start` however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`yarn <script>`|Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`analyze`|This command will generate a `stats.json` file from your production build which you can upload to the [webpack analyzer](https://webpack.github.io/analyse/) This analyzer will visualize your dependencies and chunks with detailed statistics about the bundle size.|
|`build`|Preps your app for deployment (does not run tests). Optimizes and minifies all files, piping them to the `dist` folder.|
|`start`|Serves your app at localhost:3000. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`start:production`|Runs tests (see `yarn test`), Builds your app (see `yarn build`), Starts the production server (see `yarn start:prod`)|
|`start:prod`|Starts the production server|
|`clean:all`|description|
|`lint`|Lints your JavaScript.|
|`test`|Tests your application with the unit tests specified in the `**/tests/*.js` files throughout the application. All the `test` commands allow an optional `--[string]` argument to filter the tests run by Jest. Useful if you need to run a specific test only.|
|`coveralls`|description|

### Developer Tools

**I recommend using the [Redux DevTools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd).**
Using the chrome extension allows your monitors to run on a separate thread and affords better performance and functionality. It comes with several of the most popular monitors, is easy to configure, filters actions, and doesnâ€™t require installing any packages.

## Testing
Jest
